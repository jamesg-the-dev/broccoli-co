# Build Application
- First clone the repository

- To being the application, install node packages using `npm install`

- After installation, run `npm start`
- To execute tests run `npm test`

## Notes
- I attempted to write some tests. I'm not too familar with them but would love to learn the best practises of writing tests for components
- One test will fail because I was unsure of how to mock axios
